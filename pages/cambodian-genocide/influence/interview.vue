    Influence on Education

    <h6>What improvements have been made since the Khmer Rouge happened?  </h6> <br></br>
    <p>My generation was born after the Khmer Rouge, and the society was just starting at the time. For now, education is getting better than before, and the government really tried to make it better. Even though compared to other countries, it is still very low. However, compared to the past, it has changed drastically. When I was still in high school, the country finally started having universities (which was around 1999). However, while people in the city were provided with education (like myself),  provinces and villages had little to no access to education. The education system provided by the government is not trustable though. Private schools are more trustable, but it is very expensive, so even though it's advanced, people who can go are still limited.  Compared to before though, some people can start going to private schools now, because poverty is improving. </p> <br></br>

    <p>Poverty, it's really improved. In a good way and a bad way. When I was young, the country was really poor, and my parents were working everyday for money to support the family. My parents were working for the government. My mom was a teacher, and my dad was a policeman. However, the salary was not enough to support the family. My father, he also had another job to sustain the family as a driver. My mom also taught extra classes at school to gain more money. 
Compared to when I was younger though, people are getting better lives now, even though many are still very poor. For example, a person who’s working gets $600 per month. However, compared to the salary that they receive, their living cost is very expensive. The cost of living is very expensive compared to neighboring countries. </p> <br></br>

    <p>As for the health service, it is improving compared to the time of the Khmer Rouge. Even though most doctors were executed during the Khmer Rouge, some medical supplies still were available after the Khmer Rouge, and a medical school was rebuilt. One of the medical schools is owned by the government, and one is private. However, the hospitals do still struggle for doctors, since while most doctors work at the hospitals during the morning, they go back to their own individual clinics in the afternoon, which means doctors aren’t available all day at the hospital. While the health service is getting better than before, since before, there was nothing, and now, there is something, but they still lack equipment in hospitals. However, in the past 2 years, NGO or Non-Governmental Organisation is helping the health system in Cambodia as well as the education system. International NGOs have been funding to contribute to the improvement of health service within the country, helping doctors and teachers with training. However, there is still a roaming problem where the people do not still trust the doctors since they still believe the quality of health service is very low. This is a problem that needs to be solved soon.</p><br></br>
  
<h6>What are still underdeveloped or still not being progressed since the Khmer Rouge?  </h6><br></br>
    <p> Politics is still not stable. Everyone is still scared. We want to bring some complaints to the government, but they refuse to hear our complaints. The government hasn’t improved much since the Khmer Rouge. Especially for the new generation, they have several complaints against the current government. For example, the government took the land for people, and now, the citizens are arguing that the government should respect their human rights, and that is not something the government should do to the citizens. However, the problem is that some people are scared. This especially applies to the older generations who have lived through the Khmer Rouge period. They don’t want to see fighting and war, and they want peace, so they don’t do anything. However, the government takes advantage of that. So while the younger generations aren’t too scared of protesting against the government, there are several people from the older generation who refuse to speak out for they do not want to live through the terror like the Khmer Rouge. </p><br></br>
    <h6>How has the Khmer Rouge affected you as well as your family? </h6><br></br>
    <p>During the Khmer Rouge, my dad’s side’s grandmother lost her sisters and brothers, while my mom’s side grandparents, only some family members were killed. However, people are still affected. Another problem that happened to people is that during the Khmer Rouge, families had to separate in order to not get killed, and that caused separation, even after the Khmer Rouge period. 
</p><br></br>
    <p>Today, the older generation is still scared, is this still affecting their lives. However, the people who survived the Khmer Rouge do not talk about the Khmer Rouge as much anymore. They don’t want negatives, they are trying to move on. They are focusing on the future, not the past. They do not want to talk about the event in fear of it happening again. They do talk about the event within their family though. His grandma used to tell him about the Khmer Rouge. For me, the Khmer Rouge is a terrible mistake. They killed their own people. As part of the new generation, I never faced the Khmer Rouge and the war, but from my mom, dad, cousin, grandma, and family, I know about it. Therefore, I studied how we could make a better future for the country. The country doesn’t want any war, but a better life, future, family. I believe it is important to respect those mistakes and forget them. It does not mean to forget the terrible mistake but forget the killing part. It’s important to learn from the mistake, but it is also important to move on. It's still important to pass the message/mistake on to generations to not forget the mistake to never do this again. </p><br></br>
