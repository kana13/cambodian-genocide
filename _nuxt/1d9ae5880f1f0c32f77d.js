Moreover, they executed the children of the people they have killed in order to make sure there would be no intellect. Not only did they execute intellects, but they also executed people who could not work anymore, as well as any person who had connections with the military or the past government. There were also people who were executed even when they have not caused any crimes. This was done by torturing them and constantly accusing them of committing the listed crimes, and because of this, most of the people would lie in order to be able to finally be free from the torture that they were in. Starvation was also another common thing during this period, and many died due to this.
